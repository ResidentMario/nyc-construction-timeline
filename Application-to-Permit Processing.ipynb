    "# Application-to-Permit in New York City\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook (along with files associated with it) examines the timeline of permit application to permit issuance in New York City.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Construction Permit Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Before a new building can begin construction it has to go through a long professional vetting process. The Department of Buildings (DOB) is the principal governmental organization responsible for overseeing the inspections and paperwork required for breaking ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact process, for the building manager involved, is summarized by [this handy chart](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/homeowner/dob-forms-applications.page). Here are the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The applicant prefiles the application. Prefiling saves time, but not all applicants invoke it.\n",
    "2. The applicant submits a work plan.\n",
    "3. The plan is either professionally certified (a so-called \"pro cert\" or \"self cert\") or reviewed by the DOB.\n",
    "4. The plan is approved or denied by the DOB.\n",
    "5. Once a plan is approved, the applicant requests a work permit.\n",
    "6. DOB issues a work permit.\n",
    "7. Construction begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieving Construction Permits\n",
    "\n",
    "Construction permits are retrieved as a part of the work done by the `Permit Issuance` companion notebook, which came first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieving Application Jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "DOB publishes a list of all [building job applications](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-Job-Application-Filings/ic3t-wcy2) as a part of the New York City Open Data Portal. This application is missing new building construction (which is posted to a seperate open dataset), but contains all of the information on the preceding timeline. Retrieving these permits is merely a matter of accessing, extracting, and filtering this dataset."
